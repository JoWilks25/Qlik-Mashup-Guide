# Understanding Qlik Selection States

Qlik's associative selection model uses color coding to visually represent the relationship between data values. When you make selections in Qlik, values change colors to indicate their current state, providing immediate visual feedback about which data is included, excluded, or potentially relevant to your analysis.

## The Five Selection States

Qlik uses five distinct selection states, each represented by a specific color:

| State | Visual Representation | Description |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| Selected | Green with a check mark | Values you have explicitly chosen |
| Possible | White | Values that are associated with your selection |
| Alternative | Light gray | Values in the same field that could be selected instead |
| Excluded | Dark gray | Values that have no association with your selection |
| Selected excluded | Dark gray with a check mark | Values that were selected but later excluded by another selection |

## How Selection States Work

### Selected State (Green)

When you click on a value in a filter pane or visualization, it turns green with a check mark, indicating it's in the selected state. This filters your data to show only information associated with this selection.

For example, if you select "Health & Beauty" in a Product_Line field, it turns green to show it's your active selection[1].

### Possible State (White)

Values in white are logically associated with your current selection and represent data that's available for further analysis. These are the values that remain "possible" given your current selection.

For instance, if you've selected "Health & Beauty", products like "Aloe Vera Gel", "Body lotion", and "Face pack" might appear in white, indicating they're associated with the Health & Beauty product line[1].

### Alternative State (Light Gray)

Values in light gray represent alternative options within the same field as your selection. These are other values you could select instead of your current choice.

If you've selected "Health & Beauty" in the Product_Line field, other product lines like "Electronics" or "Food" would appear in light gray. They're excluded by your current selection but could be selected if you deselect your current choice[1][3].

### Excluded State (Dark Gray)

Values in dark gray have no logical association with your current selection. These values are filtered out because they don't match the criteria established by your selection.

For example, if you select the decade "1910s", years like 1920, 1921, and 1922 would appear in dark gray because they don't belong to the 1910s[2].

### Selected Excluded State (Dark Gray with Check Mark)

This unique state occurs when a value was initially selected but later excluded by a selection in another field. The check mark indicates it was previously selected, distinguishing it from values that were never selected.

For example, if you first select both "1910s" and "1920s" decades, then subsequently select only years "1914, 1915, and 1916", the "1920s" value would become selected excluded. It was originally selected, but your selection of specific years from the 1910s logically excludes it[2][3].

## The Logic Behind Selection States

Selection states in Qlik are based on two different aspects:

1. **Input state**: The selection you've made - whether a field value is selected or not
2. **Output state**: Whether the field value is possible or not, given the logical inference of your selection[2][4]

This creates the four basic combinations (with selected excluded being a special case):
- Selected possible (green)
- Optional/possible (white)
- Alternative (light gray)
- Excluded (dark gray)

## Why Selection States Matter

The color-coding system is a hallmark of Qlik's associative model and provides several benefits:

- Instantly shows relationships between data points
- Reveals unexpected data patterns when values turn gray
- Helps discover new insights about your data
- Provides immediate visual feedback about your selections

For example, when a value unexpectedly turns gray after a selection, it can reveal insights like a region without sales representatives or a product with no sales during a quarter[6].

Understanding these states is essential for effective data exploration in Qlik, as they guide your analysis by visually representing the logical relationships in your data.
