# Qlik Mashup Guide

## Overview
This repo holds several different documents explaining how qlik works and the basics necessary to start Qlik Mashup Development.

## What is Qlik Mashup Development?
Qlik mashup development is a web development approach that allows you to integrate Qlik Sense visualizations and analytics capabilities into custom web pages or applications. Mashups combine Qlik Sense content with other web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular, React, or jQuery) to create tailored user experiences beyond what's possible in native Qlik Sense applications[1][2]. Using Qlik's Capability APIs, developers can connect to Qlik's associative engine via WebSocket connections, embed visualizations, make selections, and create dynamic, interactive applications that leverage Qlik's powerful data processing capabilities while providing complete control over the user interface and experience[1][3]. This approach is particularly valuable when organizations need customized interfaces, enhanced functionality, or want to embed analytics within existing web applications[2][5].
